# Brick Art instructor

This repository is the project repo for the Brick Art instructor app. 
The Brick Art Instructor app is available for iOS and macOS with an Android port in progress.

## App

I bought myself a LEGO® ART 31205 Jim Lee Batman™ Collection a few weeks ago, although I‘m not even that big of a Batman fan. I was intrigued by the idea to change the motive to something I like, just because the idea of construction bricks allows me to be creative and make it my own. Problem was, I‘m lazy at times and I didn‘t want to figure out a manual way to build a custom motive, and eventually do so, over and over again every time I want something different. So I thought, when I do the process one time anyway, I can make it easier for future-me when I build it as an app.
And here I am, telling you about the Brick Art Instructor.




## Project

This repository (in theory) will contain multiple modules for different target platforms and their respective documentations. The current focus is on iOS and macOS target platforms.
The project is developed with the Swift Playground app(s) on iOS and macOS with a shared project code base „Brick Art Instructor.swiftpm“. The reasons behind this is a personal interest in learning Swift and limit myself to an iPad to do so (this limitation loosened)

The playground project targets iOS 16 or newer and macOS 13 or newer
The code style is most likely a wild mixture between Swift 2.0 and Swift 5.0 and everything in-between (it also lacks in-code documentation)

The project is licensed under GPL 3.0 and free to use and adopt by everyone. I myself used countless resources available online, like HackingWithSwift, StackOverflow, Medium, GitHub and many many more. Without those and other who share their knowledge, I wouldn‘t be able to do what do and love. 
This is one of my attempts to acknowledge this and share my knowledge as well.


## Requirements

You‘ll need Swift Playground for macOS or iOS (iPad)
You‘ll need a Git client to clone the core repository (https://github.com/TobiasPott/SwiftPG-BAICore) or another way to get the ‚.swiftpm‘ folder on your iOS device

for iOS Distribution 
you‘ll need an Apple Developer Account to use AppStoreConnect and TestFlight for testing or publishing

for macOS Distribution
you‘ll need an Apple Developer Account to use AppStoreConnect and TestFlight for testing or publishing
! You can install your app locally and possibly transfer it manually between systems, this isn‘t an option for targeting iOS


## Build

Open the ‚Brick Art Instructor.swiftpm‘ folder with your Swift Playground app (or double click, it should be recognised the app to open automatically).
Have a little patience for the playground to compile the app.
You‘re ready to go and play around with the code & app in the preview, run it or publish it.
